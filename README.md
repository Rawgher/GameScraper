# GameScraper

## Application Description
Welcome to GameScraper! This application allows you to scrape theverge.com/games for their most recent gaming news. Feel free to save an article and add any comments you would like to it on my site. Each article div has a clickable image and tagline that will take you to the actual article. You will also be provided a link to the actual article when you visit an article that you would like to comment on.

## Local Installation
First, clone the respository locally. You will then need to run an ```npm install``` on your command line.

After the dependencies have been installed, you can start the application using ```node server.js```. This application runs on ```Port 8080```, so please have this port open.

You will then be able to view the application at http://localhost:8080.
